# Vegetables-Detection-Using-YOLOv11-VEGGIEVISION-

## **Description:**
VeggieVision is an AI-powered vegetable detection system designed to identify and classify vegetables in real-time. Built using YOLOv11, this project aims to achieve high accuracy (>0.80 mAP) while maintaining an inference time of <100ms per image on CPU.

ðŸ“Š Dataset & Training Details
Dataset Size: 641 images (70% Train, 15% Validation, 15% Test)
Preprocessing: Images resized to 640x640 pixels, augmented with flips, rotations, and brightness adjustments.
Training Config: 30 epochs, input image size 240x240 pixels, horizontal flips, and shear augmentation.
